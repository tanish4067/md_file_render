# JPMC CCAR Analyst II – Macro Interview Practice (GDP, Unemployment, Inflation, Rates, Yields)

Format:
- Each topic has 5 story-style chains.
- Each chain starts simple and then connects to other macro/CCAR angles.
- Answers are **bulleted and concise** so you can rehearse quickly.
- Scenarios are **mostly US with CCAR framing**, with an occasional India comparison.

---

## 1. GDP – Question Chains

### Chain 1 – Basic GDP shock and CCAR scenario design

**Q1.1**  
The Fed’s severely adverse CCAR scenario assumes US real GDP falls 3% over a year. Conceptually, what does a 3% fall in real GDP mean for the economy?

- **Answer:**
  - Real output (goods and services) produced in the economy is shrinking by 3% versus the previous year.
  - Indicates a broad-based contraction, not just price effects (because it is **real**, inflation-adjusted GDP).

**Q1.2 (follow-up)**  
In CCAR, why is a decline in **real** GDP more relevant for credit loss projections than a decline in **nominal** GDP?

- **Answer:**
  - Real GDP captures volume of economic activity; it is more closely linked to employment, income, and default risk.
  - Nominal GDP can be distorted by inflation; high inflation with flat real activity may not raise defaults the same way.

**Q1.3 (follow-up, trickier)**  
If real GDP is falling but nominal GDP is flat to slightly positive, what does that imply about inflation, and why might that combination be especially painful for banks’ retail borrowers?

- **Answer:**
  - Implies positive inflation (prices up while real output down).
  - Borrowers face higher cost of living while incomes and employment weaken, increasing default risk on loans and cards.

### Chain 2 – GDP components and sectoral impact

**Q2.1**  
US GDP suddenly slows from 2.5% growth to 0%. Data show that the main drag is a sharp fall in residential investment. Which GDP component is this, and what does it signal?

- **Answer:**
  - Component: **Investment (I)**, specifically residential fixed investment.
  - Signals weaker housing activity, potential stress in construction, real estate, and mortgage credit.

**Q2.2 (follow-up)**  
As a CCAR analyst at JPMC, which portfolios would you be most concerned about in a scenario where residential investment collapses, but consumption is still stable?

- **Answer:**
  - Mortgage and home equity portfolios.
  - Construction and real-estate developer lending.
  - Related sectors: building materials, construction equipment leasing.

**Q2.3 (follow-up, connecting to unemployment)**  
If residential investment collapses, what is the likely impact on unemployment in construction-related sectors, and how does that feed back into consumer credit quality?

- **Answer:**
  - Higher sector-specific unemployment in construction and real estate services.
  - Affected workers may default more on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, raising loss rates in those segments.

---

### Chain 3 – GDP, output gap, and inflation

**Q3.1**  
Potential US real GDP growth is estimated at 1.8% per year, but actual growth runs at 0.5% for several years. What does this suggest about the output gap?

- **Answer:**
  - Actual growth is below potential; cumulative underperformance implies a **negative output gap**.
  - Economy is running below capacity (idle labor and capital).

**Q3.2 (follow-up, inflation link)**  
With a persistent negative output gap, what is the usual directional effect on inflation, and why?

- **Answer:**
  - Downward pressure on inflation (or disinflation).
  - Weak demand relative to capacity reduces firms’ pricing power and wage bargaining power.

**Q3.3 (follow-up, trickier, CCAR twist)**  
In CCAR, why can a negative output gap with **low inflation** still be associated with **high credit losses**?

- **Answer:**
  - Output gap means weak growth, higher unemployment, and income stress despite low inflation.
  - Credit losses are driven mainly by job and income shocks, not just price levels.

---

### Chain 4 – GDP measurement and revisions

**Q4.1**  
Advance US GDP estimates show -0.5% quarterly annualized growth, but later revisions push it to +0.3%. As a risk analyst, why should you be cautious about reacting strongly to the first print?

- **Answer:**
  - GDP data are revised; initial estimates can be noisy and misleading.
  - Overreacting could distort internal scenario narratives and limit-setting.

**Q4.2 (follow-up)**  
How might you incorporate the risk of GDP data revisions into CCAR scenario calibration or model validation?

- **Answer:**
  - Use longer history and ranges, not single prints, to calibrate sensitivities.
  - Run sensitivity tests around alternative GDP paths (e.g., more severe or milder than first print).

**Q4.3 (India comparison)**  
India’s quarterly GDP data also undergo revisions and have measurement challenges in the informal sector. Why might GDP be an even noisier signal there, and what alternative indicators could be used alongside GDP in stress testing?

- **Answer:**
  - Large informal sector and data gaps make GDP estimates less precise.
  - Use high-frequency indicators: GST collections, power demand, mobility, PMI, credit growth as cross-checks.

---

### Chain 5 – GDP, fiscal policy, and crowding out

**Q5.1**  
US government launches a large fiscal stimulus equal to 5% of GDP during a deep recession. In the short run, what is the expected impact on real GDP and output gap?

- **Answer:**
  - Short-run boost to real GDP via higher government spending and transfers.
  - Output gap narrows as demand recovers toward potential.

**Q5.2 (follow-up, interest rates and yields)**  
If the economy is close to full employment and the same 5% of GDP stimulus is applied, what is the risk for inflation and interest rates?

- **Answer:**
  - Risk of overheating: demand above capacity → higher inflation.
  - Fed may hike policy rates faster; bond yields could rise on inflation and deficit concerns.

**Q5.3 (CCAR angle, tricky)**  
In a CCAR scenario with **high fiscal deficits and rising yields**, why might banks still see **weak loan growth** despite government stimulus?

- **Answer:**
  - Higher yields and tighter monetary policy can crowd out private borrowing.
  - Uncertainty and higher debt service costs can dampen corporate and consumer willingness to take new loans.

---

## 2. Unemployment – Question Chains

### Chain 6 – Basic unemployment shock and credit risk

**Q6.1**  
The CCAR severely adverse scenario assumes US unemployment rises from 4% to 10%. Broadly, how does this affect consumer credit portfolios?

- **Answer:**
  - Higher job losses → more missed payments and defaults on mortgages, autos, and credit cards.
  - Loss given default may also increase as distressed borrowers have fewer options.

**Q6.2 (follow-up, chain to GDP)**  
How does such a rise in unemployment typically relate to GDP, and which empirical relationship is often used to describe it?

- **Answer:**
  - Associated with a significant fall below potential GDP.
  - **Okun’s law**: changes in unemployment relate negatively to deviations of GDP from trend.

**Q6.3 (tricky)**  
If unemployment spikes mainly in **low‑income service jobs** while high‑income employment stays stable, how might that shape the pattern of losses across JPMC’s products?

- **Answer:**
  - Higher strain on mass-market credit cards, personal loans, and subprime auto.
  - Less impact on prime jumbo mortgages or wealth management clients.

---

### Chain 7 – Long-term vs short-term unemployment

**Q7.1**  
US unemployment rises from 4% to 7%, but long‑term unemployment (27+ weeks) rises much more sharply. Why is **long‑term** unemployment especially concerning for credit risk?

- **Answer:**
  - Long spells reduce savings, employability, and re‑hire probability.
  - Leads to deeper and more persistent credit distress and write‑offs.

**Q7.2 (follow-up, CCAR)**  
In CCAR modeling, why might you want to separately consider the long‑term unemployment rate, not just the headline unemployment rate?

- **Answer:**
  - Long‑term unemployment better captures persistent income loss and chronic delinquency.
  - It helps explain longer tail of non‑performing loans beyond the initial shock.

**Q7.3 (India angle)**  
In India, much of the labor force is informal. Why might standard unemployment figures understate stress, and what alternative labor indicators could a bank track?

- **Answer:**
  - Informal/self‑employed workers may not appear as officially unemployed.
  - Track underemployment, labor force participation, rural distress indicators, and CMIE surveys.

---

### Chain 8 – Unemployment, inflation, and the Phillips curve

**Q8.1**  
Unemployment falls from 6% to 3.5% in the US over a few years. What would a traditional Phillips curve suggest about inflation?

- **Answer:**
  - Lower unemployment → tighter labor market → upward pressure on wage and price inflation.

**Q8.2 (follow-up, tricky)**  
Suppose inflation stays surprisingly low despite very low unemployment. Give two reasons this might happen.

- **Answer:**
  - Globalization and technology restraining wage growth and pricing power.
  - Anchored inflation expectations and strong central bank credibility.

**Q8.3 (CCAR twist)**  
In a CCAR adverse scenario, unemployment rises but inflation also rises (stagflation). Why is this combination particularly challenging for monetary policy and for banks’ risk management?

- **Answer:**
  - Central bank faces trade‑off: fight inflation (higher rates) vs. support jobs (lower rates).
  - Banks face both weaker borrowers (job loss) and higher funding/discount rates.

---

### Chain 9 – Sectoral unemployment and portfolio segmentation

**Q9.1**  
A downturn hits US manufacturing hard, with manufacturing unemployment spiking but services stable. As JPMC, which lending portfolios might you flag as higher risk?

- **Answer:**
  - Commercial loans to manufacturing firms and their suppliers.
  - Auto loans in manufacturing-heavy regions; local SME loans linked to factories.

**Q9.2 (follow-up)**  
How can **regional unemployment** differences be integrated into CCAR loss models?

- **Answer:**
  - Use regional macro variables (state-level unemployment, home prices) as drivers.
  - Segment portfolios by geography and calibrate region-specific sensitivities.

**Q9.3 (tricky, cross-topic)**  
If manufacturing unemployment rises due to a global demand slowdown, what is the likely impact on US GDP and the trade balance?

- **Answer:**
  - US GDP growth slows as exports and manufacturing output decline.
  - Trade deficit may shrink if imports also fall with weaker domestic demand, or stay wide if imports remain strong.

---

### Chain 10 – Unemployment benefits, policy response, and moral hazard

**Q10.1**  
During a recession, the US expands unemployment benefits significantly. Short term, how does this affect consumer credit risk?

- **Answer:**
  - Supports household income, reducing immediate defaults on loans and cards.
  - Smooths consumption temporarily.

**Q10.2 (follow-up, tricky)**  
Why might very generous and prolonged benefits create a slightly slower decline in unemployment even after recovery starts, and how is that relevant for CCAR horizon assumptions?

- **Answer:**
  - May reduce incentives to accept low‑paying jobs, slowing re‑employment.
  - CCAR scenarios over several years must reflect slower unemployment normalization and extended credit stress.

**Q10.3 (India angle)**  
India has weaker formal unemployment insurance. In an Indian stress scenario, how does that change the transmission from unemployment shocks to credit losses?

- **Answer:**
  - Income loss is less cushioned; defaults can spike more quickly.
  - Informal coping mechanisms (family networks, gold loans) may partly buffer but are uneven.

---

## 3. Inflation – Question Chains

### Chain 11 – Demand-pull inflation and monetary policy

**Q11.1**  
US inflation rises from 2% to 5% driven mainly by strong demand and wage growth. What type of inflation is this typically called?

- **Answer:**
  - **Demand-pull** inflation.

**Q11.2 (follow-up)**  
How would the Fed typically react in terms of policy rates, and what is the expected direction of short-term interest rates?

- **Answer:**
  - Fed is likely to **raise** policy rates to cool demand and bring inflation down.
  - Short-term market rates move up with the policy rate.

**Q11.3 (CCAR twist)**  
In CCAR, when inflation is high due to overheating, why might banks still see relatively good asset quality in the short run?

- **Answer:**
  - Strong growth and employment support borrowers’ incomes and repayment capacity.
  - Credit stress often appears with a lag, when tightening slows the economy.

---

### Chain 12 – Cost-push (supply shock) inflation

**Q12.1**  
Global oil prices double suddenly, pushing US headline inflation from 2% to 7%, while growth slows. What kind of inflation shock is this?

- **Answer:**
  - **Cost-push** or **supply shock** inflation.

**Q12.2 (follow-up, monetary policy dilemma)**  
Why is cost-push inflation particularly difficult for central banks compared to pure demand-pull inflation?

- **Answer:**
  - Raising rates fights inflation but further weakens growth.
  - Keeping rates low supports growth but risks unanchored inflation expectations.

**Q12.3 (India COVID comparison, tricky)**  
During Covid, many expected inflation to rise due to supply disruptions, which would normally imply higher policy rates. But RBI **cut** the repo rate. Why?

- **Answer:**
  - Demand collapsed sharply; priority was to support growth and financial stability.
  - Central bank looked through temporary supply-driven inflation, focusing on deep output gap.

---

### Chain 13 – Core vs headline inflation

**Q13.1**  
Headline US CPI jumps due to food and energy prices, but core inflation (excluding food and energy) remains stable. Why do policymakers focus heavily on **core** inflation?

- **Answer:**
  - Core excludes volatile items and better reflects underlying, persistent inflation trends.

**Q13.2 (follow-up)**  
For CCAR modeling, why might you sometimes still care about headline inflation, especially in the short run?

- **Answer:**
  - Headline drives real purchasing power and sentiment.
  - Spikes in energy/food directly hit households’ budgets and can raise near‑term delinquencies.

**Q13.3 (tricky)**  
If headline inflation is high but core is low, how might the **yield curve** react differently in the very short end vs. longer maturities?

- **Answer:**
  - Short end may move up if markets expect temporary policy tightening.
  - Longer end may move less if investors see the spike as transitory; curve could flatten.

---

### Chain 14 – Inflation expectations and credibility

**Q14.1**  
Inflation expectations in US surveys move from 2% to 4%. Why is such a move worrying for a central bank even before actual inflation rises that much?

- **Answer:**
  - Expected inflation influences wage demands and pricing behavior.
  - Once expectations de‑anchor, it is harder and costlier to bring inflation back down.

**Q14.2 (follow-up, CCAR)**  
In a CCAR scenario with de‑anchored inflation expectations, what happens to the required severity of rate hikes and bond yield shocks?

- **Answer:**
  - Scenarios may assume larger and more sustained rate hikes.
  - Long‑term yields rise as inflation risk premia increase.

**Q14.3 (tricky)**  
How could rising inflation expectations affect **bank deposits** and funding costs?

- **Answer:**
  - Depositors may demand higher rates or move into higher‑yielding instruments.
  - Banks’ funding costs increase, pressuring net interest margins.

---

### Chain 15 – Disinflation/deflation and debt dynamics

**Q15.1**  
US inflation falls from 2% to 0% (disinflation), close to deflation. Why can this be dangerous for a highly indebted economy?

- **Answer:**
  - Real value of debt rises when prices stop increasing.
  - Borrowers’ real debt burden becomes heavier, raising default risk.

**Q15.2 (follow-up, CCAR)**  
In a CCAR deflation scenario, why might **credit losses** rise even though prices are not increasing?

- **Answer:**
  - Deflation often occurs with weak growth, falling wages, and high unemployment.
  - Income stress dominates, making debts harder to service.

**Q15.3 (tricky, yields link)**  
How can persistent low inflation or deflation contribute to very low or even negative long-term government bond yields?

- **Answer:**
  - Investors expect low nominal growth and low inflation for long.
  - Demand for safe assets pushes yields down; real yields may still be positive.

## 4. Interest Rates – Question Chains

### Chain 16 – Policy rates and transmission

**Q16.1**  
The Fed cuts the federal funds rate from 2.5% to near 0% in response to a severe downturn. What is the basic intended macroeconomic effect?

- **Answer:**
  - Stimulate borrowing and spending by lowering the cost of credit.
  - Support GDP and reduce the rise in unemployment.

**Q16.2 (follow-up, bank P&L)**  
How do such cuts typically affect banks’ **net interest margins (NIMs)** in the short run?

- **Answer:**
  - Asset yields fall; deposit rates cannot always go equally low.
  - NIMs often compress, though funding relief can partly offset.

**Q16.3 (tricky)**  
If the policy rate is at zero but banks are risk‑averse, why might credit growth still remain weak?

- **Answer:**
  - Tight underwriting and higher risk premia offset lower policy rates.
  - Borrower demand may be weak due to uncertainty and low confidence.

---

### Chain 17 – Yield curve shape and recession signals

**Q17.1**  
The US yield curve inverts: 2‑year Treasury yields exceed 10‑year yields. Historically, what does this often signal about future GDP and unemployment?

- **Answer:**
  - Often precedes a recession (future GDP slowdown or contraction).
  - Unemployment likely to rise with a lag.

**Q17.2 (follow-up, CCAR)**  
Why is an inverted yield curve a useful feature in CCAR models for projecting credit losses?

- **Answer:**
  - It encapsulates market expectations of future monetary tightening and slowdown.
  - Acts as an early warning variable for upcoming macro stress.

**Q17.3 (tricky)**  
How does an inverted curve affect banks’ traditional “borrow short, lend long” business model?

- **Answer:**
  - Long‑term lending becomes less profitable relative to short‑term funding cost.
  - Can compress margins and discourage long‑term lending.

---

### Chain 18 – Real vs nominal interest rates

**Q18.1**  
Nominal 10‑year Treasury yield is 4%, and expected inflation is 2%. What is the approximate ex‑ante real interest rate?

- **Answer:**
  - Real rate ≈ 4% − 2% = **2%**.

**Q18.2 (follow-up)**  
For corporate borrowers, why is the **real** interest rate more relevant than the nominal rate when deciding investment?

- **Answer:**
  - Real rate reflects true cost of borrowing after inflation.
  - A lower real rate makes investment projects more attractive.

**Q18.3 (India angle, tricky)**  
If RBI’s repo is 6.5% and inflation is 6%, while US fed funds is 5% with inflation 3%, in which country are **real** policy rates higher, and what does that imply for growth vs inflation trade‑offs?

- **Answer:**
  - India: real ≈ 0.5%; US: real ≈ 2%.
  - Higher real rates in US are more restrictive for growth but stronger for anchoring inflation.

---

### Chain 19 – Rate hikes and banking sector stress

**Q19.1**  
The Fed hikes rates rapidly from 0.25% to 5% to combat high inflation. How does this shock affect existing fixed‑rate bond portfolios of banks?

- **Answer:**
  - Market value of existing fixed‑rate bonds falls.
  - Unrealized losses may rise on available‑for‑sale/held‑to‑maturity portfolios.

**Q19.2 (follow-up, credit)**  
How do rapid rate hikes typically affect **credit risk** for leveraged borrowers?

- **Answer:**
  - Interest expense rises, especially on floating‑rate debt.
  - Higher probability of distress and defaults among highly leveraged firms and households.

**Q19.3 (tricky, CCAR framing)**  
Why must CCAR scenarios with rate shocks also stress **funding liquidity**, not just credit and market risk?

- **Answer:**
  - Higher rates can trigger deposit outflows into higher‑yield instruments.
  - Funding costs and availability can deteriorate, creating liquidity stress.

---

### Chain 20 – Zero lower bound and unconventional policy

**Q20.1**  
At the zero lower bound, conventional rate cuts are exhausted. What unconventional tools did major central banks, including the Fed, use after the Global Financial Crisis?

- **Answer:**
  - Quantitative easing (asset purchases).
  - Forward guidance and longer‑term refinancing operations.

**Q20.2 (follow-up, yields)**  
How does large‑scale asset purchases by the Fed generally affect long‑term Treasury yields?

- **Answer:**
  - Increases demand for long‑term bonds, pushing their prices up and yields down.

**Q20.3 (CCAR twist)**  
Why should CCAR scenarios sometimes consider the **withdrawal** of such unconventional support (QT – quantitative tightening)?

- **Answer:**
  - QT can raise long‑term yields and risk premia.
  - Could trigger repricing of assets, funding stress, and new credit losses.

---

## 5. Bond Yields – Question Chains

### Chain 21 – Basics of bond prices and yields

**Q21.1**  
If market interest rates rise, what happens to existing fixed‑coupon bond prices and why?

- **Answer:**
  - Existing bond prices **fall**.
  - Their fixed coupons become less attractive versus new higher‑yield issues.

**Q21.2 (follow-up)**  
Why do long‑duration bonds fall more in price than short‑duration bonds when yields rise?

- **Answer:**
  - Long‑duration bonds have cash flows farther in the future, which are more sensitive to discount rate changes.

**Q21.3 (CCAR angle)**  
In CCAR market shock scenarios, why are banks’ holdings of long‑duration securities particularly important to stress?

- **Answer:**
  - They can show large mark‑to‑market losses under yield shocks.
  - Losses can affect capital and liquidity metrics.

---

### Chain 22 – Term premium and expectations hypothesis

**Q22.1**  
Under the expectations hypothesis, what does a 10‑year yield approximately represent in terms of short‑term rates?

- **Answer:**
  - Roughly the average expected short‑term rates over the next 10 years.

**Q22.2 (follow-up, term premium)**  
What is the **term premium**, and why does it matter for interpreting long‑term yields?

- **Answer:**
  - Extra yield investors demand to hold long‑term bonds instead of rolling short‑term ones.
  - Affects long yields independently of rate expectations.

**Q22.3 (tricky, CCAR)**  
In a CCAR scenario with rising risk aversion, how might the term premium move, and what does that imply for long‑term yields even if expected policy rates do not change much?

- **Answer:**
  - Term premium may **rise** due to higher uncertainty and risk aversion.
  - Long‑term yields could increase even without big changes in expected short‑term rates.

---

### Chain 23 – Credit spreads and recession

**Q23.1**  
During a recession, yields on US investment‑grade corporate bonds rise from 4% to 7%, while Treasury yields rise only slightly. What does this indicate about **credit spreads**?

- **Answer:**
  - Credit spreads have widened significantly.
  - Markets demand more compensation for default and downgrade risk.

**Q23.2 (follow-up)**  
How does a sharp widening in credit spreads typically affect banks’ corporate lending business?

- **Answer:**
  - Higher borrowing costs for corporates; some projects become unviable.
  - Potential rise in non‑performing loans and weaker loan demand.

**Q23.3 (tricky, GDP link)**  
How do widening credit spreads and weak GDP growth reinforce each other in a negative feedback loop?

- **Answer:**
  - Weak GDP → higher credit risk → wider spreads.
  - Wider spreads → less investment and hiring → further GDP weakness.

---

### Chain 24 – Sovereign yields, fiscal stress, and banks

**Q24.1**  
A country’s government debt‑to‑GDP ratio surges, and its sovereign bond yields jump. What does this say about investors’ perception of fiscal risk?

- **Answer:**
  - Investors perceive higher risk of fiscal stress or default.
  - Demand higher yields to hold government debt.

**Q24.2 (follow-up, banks’ balance sheets)**  
Why are banks in that country particularly vulnerable if they hold large amounts of domestic government bonds?

- **Answer:**
  - Rising yields reduce bond prices, causing mark‑to‑market or capital losses.
  - Creates a sovereign–bank feedback loop.

**Q24.3 (India twist)**  
In India, banks often hold significant amounts of government securities to meet SLR requirements. How does that shape their interest rate risk when yields move sharply?

- **Answer:**
  - Exposes banks to large valuation swings when government yields move.
  - Regulatory treatment and HTM limits become critical for managing this risk.

---

### Chain 25 – Yield curve, funding costs, and profitability

**Q25.1**  
The US yield curve steepens: short‑term rates stay near 1%, while long‑term rates rise from 3% to 5%. How does this typically affect banks’ net interest margins?

- **Answer:**
  - Steeper curve can improve NIMs if banks fund short and lend long.

**Q25.2 (follow-up)**  
Why might a steep yield curve not automatically translate into higher loan growth?

- **Answer:**
  - Borrower demand may be weak if economic outlook is uncertain.
  - Credit standards may remain tight after a crisis.

**Q25.3 (tricky, CCAR)**  
In CCAR scenario design, why is it important to stress both the **level** and the **slope** of the yield curve?

- **Answer:**
  - Level affects overall funding and discount rates.
  - Slope affects margins, business model viability, and valuations across maturities.
